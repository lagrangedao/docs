# Task

### Task definition

Bidders have the ability to set a limit on the number of bids they can process at the same time. This feature prevents them from accepting new bids once they reach their specified limit, enabling bidders to effectively manage their workload and participate in multiple tasks without overextending themselves. User can convert a space to a task:

| Role     | Action         |
| -------- | -------------- |
| Task     | Created        |
| Task     | Accepting Bids |
| Task/Job | Bid Closed     |
| Job      | Submitted      |
| Task/Job | Completed      |
| Task/Job | Failed         |
| Task     | Cancelled      |
