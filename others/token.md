# Token

## &#x20;Multichain Access

#### Support access his data

* need sign but no need to have balance

#### Payment from metamask



## Integration with FilSwan

* SDK level service&#x20;

### Key Requirement from user

* Which chain we should support?
* Which is the basechain?
* if we make a payment for a job,  can we access it from another chain to check the result?
* Access different resource on difference chains.
* Message validation
  * Validator?
  * message bridging?
* resource need to purchase:
  * IPFS
  * Bandwith
  * CPU
  * GPU

### User Scenario

Assume we have a space,want to purchase the IPFS and computing, we also want to reward the dataset owner

* User using ARB
* He pay ALAD (LAD on ARB)
* payment confirmed
* MCS open access to him of the storage
  * actually it is LAD platform storage
* User can access the storage&#x20;
* He want to reserve CPU for running his instance
  * he pay CP for the computing resource
  * the payment on ARB? We need a similar contract on ARB for receiving funds
  * open the service for him
* Will CP have multichain wallet? since user is from different chain

### &#x20;Computing proof

#### ZK of payment/Task aggregator

* ZK of task submission with result
* zk Validator

#### w3 Merkle Tree

* Fast validate if the tx belongs to the w3id
* submit onchain
* all the information of the origin data proof will be stored \<where? track B?>
