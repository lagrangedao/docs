# Diffuser/Transformer

#### About Diffuser

Diffusers is the go-to library for state-of-the-art pretrained diffusion models for generating images, audio, and even 3D structures of molecules. Whether youâ€™re looking for a simple inference solution or want to train your own diffusion model, Diffusers is a modular toolbox that supports both.

#### About Transformer

Transformers provides APIs and tools to easily download and train state-of-the-art pretrained models. Using pretrained models can reduce your compute costs, carbon footprint, and save you the time and resources required to train a model from scratch.
