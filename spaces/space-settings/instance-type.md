# Instance Type

### Instance Type Naming Convention <a href="#instance-type-names" id="instance-type-names"></a>

Instance types are named based on their family, generation, processor family, additional capabilities, and size.

* The first position of the instance type name indicates the instance family, for example `p`.&#x20;
* The second position indicates the instance generation, for example `1`.&#x20;
* The third position indicates the processor family, for example `a`.&#x20;
* The remaining letters before the period indicate additional capabilities, such as instance store volumes.&#x20;
* After the period (`.`) is the instance size, such as `small` or `4xlarge`.
