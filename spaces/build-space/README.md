# Build Space

After creating a Space, you'll have an empty repository where it's time to develop your code.&#x20;

The sample app will consist of the following three files:

* `requirements.txt` — Lists the dependencies of a Python project or application
* `README.md`— a markdown file that gives other users a detailed description of your Space and will be displayed on the Space card.
* `Configuration file` - a `Dockerfile` or a YAML file which is written using Lagrange's declarative configuration language (LDL).

You can conveniently create each file through the web interface or upload them via the same interface or using lagrange-cli.
