# Build Space

After creating a Space, you'll have an empty repository where it's time to develop your code.&#x20;

The sample app will consist of the following three files:

* `requirements.txt` — Lists the dependencies of a Python project or application
* `README.md`— a markdown file that gives other users a detailed description of your Space and will be displayed on the Space card.
* `Configuration file` - a `Dockerfile` or a `Deploy.yaml`&#x20;
  * A `Dockerfile` is a text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image.&#x20;
  * A `Deploy.yaml` is a configuration file, written using [Lagrange Definition Language (LDL)](../intro/lagrange-definition-language-ldl.md)**,** which is used to specify deployment details for a Space on the Lagrange.

You can conveniently **create** each file through the web interface or **upload** them via the same interface or using lagrange-cli.
