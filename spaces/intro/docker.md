# Docker

Spaces accommodate custom [Docker containers](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/) for apps outside the scope of Streamlit and Gradio.&#x20;

Docker Spaces allow users to go beyond the limits of what was previously possible with the standard SDKs.&#x20;

From FastAPI and Go endpoints to Phoenix apps and ML Ops tools, Docker Spaces can help in many different setups.

### Setting up Docker Spaces

Selecting **Docker** as the SDK when creating a new Space will initialize your Space by setting the `sdk` property to `docker` in your `README.md` file‚Äôs YAML block.&#x20;

Alternatively, given an existing Space repository, set `sdk: docker` inside the `YAML` block at the top of your Spaces **README.md** file.&#x20;

You can also change the default exposed port `7860` by setting `app_port: 7860`. Afterward, you can create a usual `Dockerfile`.

```
---
title: Basic Docker SDK Space
emoji: üê≥
colorFrom: purple
colorTo: gray
sdk: docker
app_port: 7860
---
```

Internally you could have as many open ports as you want. For instance, you can install Elasticsearch inside your Space and call it internally on its default port 9200.

If you want to expose apps served on multiple ports to the outside world, a workaround is to use a reverse proxy like Nginx to dispatch requests from the broader internet (on a single port) to different internal ports.

### Secrets and Variables Management

You can manage a Space's environment variables in the Space Settings.&#x20;

#### Variables

**Buildtime**

Variables are passed as `build-arg`s when building your Docker Space. Read [Docker‚Äôs dedicated documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#arg) for a complete guide on how to use this in the Dockerfile.



```
	# Declare your environment variables with the ARG directive
	ARG MODEL_REPO_NAME

	FROM python:latest
	# [...]
	# You can use them like environment variables
	RUN predict.py $MODEL_REPO_NAME
```

**Runtime**

Variables are injected in the container‚Äôs environment at runtime.

#### Secrets

**Buildtime**

In Docker Spaces, the secrets management is different for security reasons. Once you create a secret in the Settings tab, you can expose the secret by adding the following line in your Dockerfile:

For example, if `SECRET_EXAMPLE` is the name of the secret you created in the Settings tab, you can read it at build time by mounting it to a file, then reading it with `$(cat /run/secrets/SECRET_EXAMPLE)`.

See an example below:

```
# Expose the secret SECRET_EXAMPLE at buildtime and use its value as git remote URL
RUN --mount=type=secret,id=SECRET_EXAMPLE,mode=0444,required=true \
 git init && \
 git remote add origin $(cat /run/secrets/SECRET_EXAMPLE)
```

```
# Expose the secret SECRET_EXAMPLE at buildtime and use its value as a Bearer token for a curl request
RUN --mount=type=secret,id=SECRET_EXAMPLE,mode=0444,required=true \
	curl test -H 'Authorization: Bearer $(cat /run/secrets/SECRET_EXAMPLE)'
```

**Runtime**

Same as for public Variables, at runtime, you can access the secrets as environment variables. For example, in Python you would use `os.environ.get("SECRET_EXAMPLE")`.&#x20;

### Permissions

The container runs with user ID 1000. To avoid permission issues you should create a user and set its `WORKDIR` before any `COPY` or download.

```
# Set up a new user named "user" with user ID 1000
RUN useradd -m -u 1000 user

# Switch to the "user" user
USER user

# Set home to the user's home directory
ENV HOME=/home/user \
	PATH=/home/user/.local/bin:$PATH

# Set the working directory to the user's home directory
WORKDIR $HOME/app

# Try and run pip command after setting the user with `USER user` to avoid permission issues with Python
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir --upgrade pip

# Copy the current directory contents into the container at $HOME/app setting the owner to the user
COPY --chown=user . $HOME/app

# Download a checkpoint
RUN mkdir content
ADD --chown=user https://<SOME_ASSET_URL> content/<SOME_ASSET_NAME>
```

If you still face permission issues, you might need to use `chmod` or `chown` in your `Dockerfile` to grant the right permissions. For example, if you want to use the directory `/data`, you can do:

```
RUN mkdir -p /data
RUN chmod 777 /data
```

You should always avoid superfluous chowns.

Rather than fixing permission by running `chown`:

```
COPY checkpoint .
RUN chown -R user checkpoint
```

you should always do:

```
COPY --chown=user checkpoint .
```

(same goes for `ADD` command)
