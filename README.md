# Introduction

Lagrange DAO is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) focused on data value realization and promoting decentralized science (DeSci). It aims to revolutionize the way scientific knowledge is created, shared, and rewarded by using the Web3 stack, which is a set of protocols and technologies that enable decentralized applications (dApps) and services on the blockchain.

Key features of Lagrange DAO include:

1. Lagrange Spaces: These are virtual spaces for data sharing and analytics, allowing researchers to collaborate on scientific projects. These spaces offer public infrastructure for storing, sharing, creating, rewarding, and disseminating scientific knowledge in a fair and equitable manner.
2. Decentralized Computing Power Renting Network: Lagrange DAO provides a platform for community members to rent out their computing power to researchers and users. This decentralized approach ensures that computing resources are available to a wide range of users, promoting accessibility and reducing the centralization of computing power.
3. Token-based incentives: To encourage participation in the platform and maintain a sustainable ecosystem, Lagrange DAO may have its native token. Researchers, contributors, and computing power providers can earn tokens for their contributions to the platform. These tokens can then be used to access services, rent computing power, or participate in governance.
4. Transparent and fair governance: As a DAO, Lagrange operates under a decentralized governance model, enabling community members to actively participate in decision-making processes. This ensures that the platform remains transparent, fair, and aligned with the best interests of its users.
5. Interoperability: Lagrange DAO is designed to be compatible with other blockchain platforms and protocols, promoting collaboration and integration with existing Web3 projects.

By leveraging blockchain technology and decentralized networks, Lagrange DAO is working towards creating a more accessible, transparent, and equitable ecosystem for scientific research and data sharing. This has the potential to drive innovation and improve the quality of scientific outputs, ultimately benefiting the broader scientific community and society as a whole.
