# Lagrange Mars Testnet Campaign

Welcome to the Lagrange Mars Testnet Campaign 2023! 

We are excited to invite you to be a part of the Lagrange Testnet, interacting with Lagrange firsthand and experiencing the groundbreaking features and functionalities Lagrange has developed for the future of Web3.

Event Duration: 14th August, 00:00 (EST) - 10th September, 23:59 (EST)

## Mission 

Lagrange's Mars Testnet is the first attempt to utilize enormous computing and storage resources of Filecoin, Chainlink, BNB Chain, and other blockchains for Web3 developers.

Over the course of four weeks, we will utilize decentralized computing power from different blockchains to create a captivating scene on Planet Mars, including:
- Landscape
- Creatures
- Vehicles, Spaceship
- Buildings and live scene
- CG/Short film

Partners from the realms of AI, gaming, and the metaverse are welcome to join us in this ambitious endeavor by contacting us at team@filswan.com.


## Goals

- Harness the power of 100 GPUs to generate 1 million images.
- Validate large-scale GPU computing on the Lagrange Network.
- Explore the adaptation of models such as Stable diffusion, Lora, and Dall-E for image generation.
- Solicit developer feedback on space building and datasets.
- Multichain Payment and debug on the payment channel.
- Validate Lagrange Network's new GPU marketplace.
- Collaborate with partners in AI, gaming, and the metaverse.
- Engage our community in the AIGC including images and scenes.
- Attract AI and ML enthusiasts/ experts to the Lagrange Network community

## Tasks and Rewards:

**Computing Provider Setup Task:**

Set up a Computing Provider with the specified requirements and keep it online during the Campaign to split **500,000 LAG** tokens based on GPU hours, with the Top 1 Computing Provider winning the Golden CP privilege.

**Space Builder Task:**

Fork and run a Space from the provided Base Space, and share it on Twitter to have a chance to split the **300,000 LAG** token prize pool based on the popularity of the created space.

**Image Creator Task:**

Create at least 3 images from any Space in Lagrange following weekly themes, upload them to MCS, and share them on Twitter to split the **200,000 LAG** token prize pool based on the popularity of the images, with top creators receiving higher rewards.

*Note: All LAD awards will be delivered in the form of NFTs, and NFT holders can claim their LAD after the TGE (Token Generated Event).*
