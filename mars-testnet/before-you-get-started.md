# Before You Get Started

Before you embark on your Lagrange Mars Testnet journey, make sure to follow these steps to participate seamlessly:

### Set Up Metamask

Setup your MetaMask wallet for the Polygon testnet: Ensure your MetaMask wallet is configured to work with the Polygon testnet. You can find [guides](https://filswan.medium.com/how-to-add-polygon-mumbai-testnet-to-metamask-16a11db91214) on how to do this online.

If you connect your wallet to the [Lagrange on Polygon Testnet](https://testnet.lagrangedao.org/), there will be options to automatically configure your wallet for the Polygon Testnet.&#x20;

Fill in the following details:

```
Network Name: Mumbai Testnet
New RPC URL: https://rpc-mumbai.maticvigil.com/
Chain ID: 80001
Currency Symbol: MATIC
Block Explorer URL: https://mumbai.polygonscan.com

```

### Connect to the Lagrange

Visit https://lagrangedao.org/ and connect your MetaMask

#### Fund Your Wallet with test MATIC Tokens

Visit the [Polygon Testnet Faucet](https://faucet.polygon.technology/). Paste your address to the faucet website and get some test MATIC tokens sent to your wallet for exploring functions on Lagrange.

Please note that the function is on the Polygon Testnet environment and speed times may differ compared to mainnet usage.
