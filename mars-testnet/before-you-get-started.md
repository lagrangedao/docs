# Before You Get Started

Before you embark on your Lagrange Mars Testnet journey, make sure to follow these steps to participate seamlessly:

### Set Up Metamask

Setup your MetaMask wallet for the Polygon testnet: Ensure your MetaMask wallet is configured to work with the Polygon testnet. You can find [guides](https://medium.com/stakingbits/how-to-connect-polygon-mumbai-testnet-to-metamask-fc3487a3871f) on how to do this online or on MetaMaskâ€™s official documentation.

If you connect your wallet to the [Lagrange on Polygon Testnet](https://testnet.lagrangedao.org/), there will be options to automatically configure your wallet for the Polygon Testnet.&#x20;

Fill in the following details:

```
Network Name: Mumbai Testnet
New RPC URL: https://rpc-mumbai.maticvigil.com/
Chain ID: 80001
